# Examples

## Purpose
Code in here is code that is perhaps not useful enough to be part of the main repository, 
but are code examples that may be useful for my reference later on. 

For example, my implementation of 2-3-4 trees is rather hasty (with some code redundancy that I think could be 
reduced if I were to implement it properly) and was purely to ensure I understood their usage. I have 
kept it here for revision purposes.
